# Writing Efficient Python Code

## Foundations for efficiencies
- Efficient: Fast, Small resource usage
- Writing readable and pythonic code

### Numpy
- Alternative to list
- Homogeneous: must contains same type
- Broadcasting: vectorize operations
- Boolean mask indexing

## Timing and profiling code

### Examining runtime
- %timeit
-  `a = {}` is faster than `a = dict()`

### Code profiling and memory usage
- detailed stats on frequency and duration of function calls
- `line_profiler` and `memory_profiler`

## Efficiencies
### combining, counting and iterating
- `Collections` and `itertools`

### Set
- `set.intersection`
- `set.difference`
- `set.union`

### Eliminating loops
- Loop is ugly
- Flat is better than nested
- list comprehension, map and numpy
- holistic conversion
	- holistic: 전체적인

### Pandas Optimization
